SPECIAL NOTE TO SKINNERS:

Our mediainfo to filenames are a work in progress, if you come across media where it's wrong please let me know
so I can modify the system to match correctly.


USAGE INSIDE EVERSION:

You can access these images using specific variables for the types of flags that best fit your eskins.   For index usage 
we recommend you use the <swap>true</swap> option with your images.  this will avoid reloading them for no reason as you move
around the index.


ALL IMAGES AND BACKGROUNDS:

All images start with the root path to the flags:  [:@sharedmedia:]purityflags/

Example background: [:@sharedmedia:]purityflags/flag_frame.png


ASPECT RATIO ICONS:

Fill in the path to the type of flags you want and use the special [:flagratio:] variable at the end.

Example: [:@sharedmedia:]purityflags/aspectratio/vanilla/[:flagaspect:].png


AUDIO ICONS:

Audio icons include # of channels and codec.

Channels variable [:flagchannels:]
Codec Variable [:flagaudiocodec:]

VIDEO ICONS:

Video icons include resolution and codec

Resolution variable [:flagresolution:]
Codec Variable [:flagvideocodec:]

CERTIFICATIONS:

There are a varity of different ratings.   Because of overlap it's recommended you make an eskin option for your users to put in the type of ratings they want:
<rating>mpaa</rating>    (mpaa, bbfc, csa, Germany are the valids for this example)

Example: [:@sharedmedia:]purityflags/ratings/custom/[:$rating,tolower:][:flagcertification:].png
