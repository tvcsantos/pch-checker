/* Yamj Watched Module
 * ==========================================================================
 * Variables in the watched function that can be changed to suit...
 * wExt    = The file extension applied to the movie/show name
 * wScript = The path and name of the CGI script
             this is a URL, it must pass thru the web server, a HTTP path
 *           (If on local disk must be executable 755)
 * wFiles  = The path only location of .watched files
 *           this is a network path not a url!
 *
 * Note that wScript and wFiles can be set in the watched.properties.js file
 *  which will override values here, thus nothing needs to changed here.
 *
 * Example wFiles
 * /opt/sybhttpd/localhost.drives/SATA_DISK/watched/
 * /opt/sybhttpd/localhost.drives/NETWORK_SHARE/PC1:USBDRIVES/Disk_2/watched/
 * /opt/sybhttpd/localhost.drives/NETWORK_SHARE/192.168.1.10:USBDRIVES/Disk_2/watched/
 *
 * Example wScript a URL is used
 * http://localhost.drives:8883/SATA_DISK/watched/watched.cgi
 * http://localhost.drives:8883/NETWORK_SHARE/PC1:USBDRIVES/Disk_2/somefolder/watched.cgi
 * http://localhost.drives:8883/NETWORK_SHARE/192.168.1.10:USBDRIVES/Disk_2/somefolder/watched.cgi
 *
 * What we might call... Create a watched file for the movie Blood Diamond
 * http://localhost.drives:8883/SATA_DISK/Video/Jukebox/watched/watched.cgi?/opt/sybhttpd/localhost.drives/SATA_DISK/Video/Jukebox/watched/Blood Diamond.watched&1&watchedCallback
 *
 * ? is the watched file name, our args are then '&' delimited, not key/value pairs
 * &0 means check if watched file exists, 1 is create or delete a toggle
 * &watchedCallback is the javascript function to call once the script is done.
 *                  the cgi prints this out, with some params eg:
 *                  watchedCallback(wAction, wStatus)
 *                  wAction what we asked, 0=check, 1=create, 1=delete (toggles)
 *                  wStatus the result, file exists, 0=false, 1=true.
 *                    Used to set the watched status the detail html page.
 *
 * If you wish to check a watched file on page load, use the body onload(...)
 *
 * The values for wScript and wFiles will be overwritten by watched.properties.js
